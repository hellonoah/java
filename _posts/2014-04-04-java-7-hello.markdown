"Be careful to pick meaningful names. I've chosen Hello for this example because the first program we're going to write is one that says Hello. One common mistake for new software developers is to choose names such as Project1 and Project2. It probably won't be long before you can't remember the details of any of them. Instead, if you're writing a minesweeper game, call your project Minesweeper. 

Then, when you're also working on an instant messaging program, you can distinguish Minesweeper from InstantMessenger much more readily than you can distinguish Project1 from Project2."


Code for our first program within Eclipse

{% highlight ruby %}
package beginning_java7.examples.hello;

import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;
import java.util.Date;

public class Hello {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// First, get the date as seconds since 1/1/1970
		// Note that a Date object also contains time information
		Date now = new Date();
		// Second, create a formatter object
		SimpleDateFormat formatter =
				new SimpleDateFormat("EEE, MMM dd, yyyy HH:mm:ss");
		// Third, apply the formatter to the date
		String formattedDate = formatter.format(now);
		// Finally, add our formatted date to our output
      System.out.println(formattedDate + "> Hello, " + args[0] + "!");
	}

}
